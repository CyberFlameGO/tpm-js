<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>TPM-JS lets you experiment with a software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Trusted Platform Module</a>  (TPM) in your browser. TPM-JS includes the following libraries:
  <ul>
    <li>Intel <a href="https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss">TPM2 Software Stack (TSS)</a>.</li>
    <li>IBM <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmswtpm2/">software TPM simulator</a>.</li>
    <li>Google <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl">BoringSSL</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>The TSS library provides high-level APIs to the TPM. It manages TPM resources,
  marshals command buffers and unmarshals response buffers.
</p>

<p>The simulator executes TPM commands. It maintains internal state and uses the BoringSSL
  library for cryptographic operations.

<blockquote>TPMs are remarkable! They are passive, low-end devices that offer <b>strong security guarantees</b>.
</blockquote>
<p>
  In this site we'll learn how TPMs work. We'll see how to use the TPM as a cryptographic
  device. We'll cover topics such as key generation, measured boot, PCRs, remote
  attestation and key sealing.
